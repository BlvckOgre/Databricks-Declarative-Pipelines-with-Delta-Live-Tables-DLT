# 🔁 StreamDLT: A Declarative CDC Pipeline with Delta Live Tables

## 🚀 Overview

**StreamDLT** is a modular and scalable end-to-end data pipeline built using **Databricks Delta Live Tables (DLT)**, designed to simulate a real-world retail environment with multiple branches ("East" and "West") and a product/customer master data system.

The project uses the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** and demonstrates how to implement **Streaming Ingestion**, **Change Data Capture (CDC)**, and **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 1 and Type 2)** declaratively.
